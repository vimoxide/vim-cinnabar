> This theme uses [srcery](https://github.com/srcery-colors/srcery-vim) as a base, which uses parts of [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox), Huge thanks to the creators and maintainers of both

## Installation
Place `cinnabar.vim` file into `colors/` folder within your Vim directory, e.g. `~/.vim/colors/`

Or simply use a plugin manager like [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):
```VimL
call plug#begin()
"  ...
  
  Plug 'vimoxide/vim-cinnabar'
call plug#end()
```

Then, put this in your `~/.vimrc`

```VimL
set termguicolors
colorscheme cinnabar
```
